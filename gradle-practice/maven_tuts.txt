maven
	- lifecycle
				- phase 1		->	goal1,goal2
				- phase 2		-> goal1,goal3
				- phase 3		-> goal4

* phase contains collection of goals(smallest unit of task)
* goals may or maynot be bounded to single PHASE, it may be bounded to multiple phase as well

PHASE
eg: compile, test, deploy e.t.c

GOAL

	PHASE:GOAL
eg:  jar:[jar] , surefire:test e.t.c



$ mvn PHASE
-> run all preceding phase(which means running goals in each phase) till this PHASE


$ mvn PHASE:GOAL
-> run this specific GOAL only (which is bounded with this PHASE)
