Gradle lifecycle consist of three phases: initialization, configuration, and execution:

During **Initialization**, Gradle decides which projects are to participate in the build.

During **Configuration**, task objects are assembled into an internal object model, usually called the DAG (for directed acyclic graph).

During **Execution**, build tasks are executed in the order required by their dependency relationships.
